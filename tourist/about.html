        <p>
            Sri lanka,historically known as Ceylon and officially the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, is an island country in South Asia. 
            It lies in the Indian Ocean, southwest of the Bay of Bengal, separated from the Indian peninsula by the Gulf of Mannar and the Palk Strait.
            It shares a maritime border with the Maldives in the southwest and India in the northwest.
            An island country, island state, or island nation is a country whose primary territory consists of one or more islands or parts of islands. Approximately
            Sri Lanka has a population of approximately 22 million and is home to many cultures, languages and ethnicities. The Sinhalese people form the majority of 
            the population, followed by the Sri Lankan Tamils, who are the largest minority group and are concentrated in northern Sri Lanka; both groups have played an
            influential role in the island's history.</p><br><br>

        <p>
            Sri Lanka's documented history goes back 3,000 years, with evidence of prehistoric human settlements dating back 125,000 years.
            The earliest known Buddhist writings of Sri Lanka, known collectively as the PƒÅli canon, date to the fourth Buddhist council, which took place in 29 BCE.
            Because its location made it a major trading hub, it was already known to both East Asians and Europeans as long ago as the Anuradhapura period.
            Sri Lanka is a developing country, ranking 73rd on the Human Development Index. 
            It is the highest-ranked South Asian nation in terms of development and has the second-highest per capita income in South Asia. 
            However,the ongoing economic crisis has resulted in the collapse of its currency, rising inflation, and a humanitarian crisis due to a severe shortage of essentials.
            The pre-history of Sri Lanka goes back 125,000 years and possibly even as far back as 500,000 years.
